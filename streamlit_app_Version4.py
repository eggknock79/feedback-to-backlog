    This app lets you upload a CSV or Excel file with consumer feedback and generates a backlog with product enhancements (EPICs & user stories).

    **Instructions:**
    - Your file should have columns for feedback, episode, and market.
    - The app will analyze feedback, surface top pain points and opportunities by episode (highlighting the markets in which they appear), and suggest EPICs and user stories.
    - User stories will follow the format: "As a [role], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]".
    - Enter your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/).
